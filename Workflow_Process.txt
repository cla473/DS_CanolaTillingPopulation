Workflow Process for AF_DataSchool Big Data Project

This discussion the processes required to work with the data provided, and produce the required 
outputs.

1. Initial Preparation:

In preparation for the processing, the metadata for the project needs to be collected from the 
various excel spreadsheets and other documents provided.

This has been done in the R Script:
  MB_cleaning_data_plants_in_pools.R

This will create the output file: metadata.csv?


2. Processing the data

This section discusses the steps required to process the data:

a.  Run fastqc over files in specified directory using the following script

    JR_Run_fastqc_directory
    
b.  Download the required genome sequence information

    JR_download_genome.sh
    Is there something else that needs to happen with file?

c.  Extract the header details from the zipped fastqc files.

    KN6_GetHeaderDetails.sh
    This will create the output file: "headers.txt"    
    
d.  Combine the headers.txt information with the metadata to generate a processing list.  This 
is done with the R Script:

    LC_Combine_Header_Metadata.R
    This will create the output file: "combined_data.csv"
    
e.  Run BWA, using the data collected in the previous step.

    PW_BWA.sh


f.  Run a script to create the sam files from the bam files

    MB_BAM_TO_SAM.sh

h.  Convertion the genome file to the correct  format   
	* make a copy of fastq.f file to fastq.fai
        * generate dictionary files.

i.  run GATK on files
